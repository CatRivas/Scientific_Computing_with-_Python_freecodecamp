# Project 2: Luhn Algorithm

### Course Description:
By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.

---

### Luhn Algorithm:
The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers, IMEI, etc.

The Luhn algorithm is as follows:

1. From the right to left, double the value of every second digit; if the product is equal or greater than 10, sum the digits of the products.
2. Take the sum of all the digits.
3. If the sum of all the digits is a multiple of 10, then the number is valid; else it is not valid.
